%%  Introduction to Plotting and Vectorization
% This lab will provide an introduction to two dimensional plots.  At
% the end, you should feel comfortable plotting functions of the form f(x).
% You should find this useful not only for visualizing the solutions of
% ODEs, but also for plotting general data that might appear in other
% courses and work.
%
% In the process we will also introduce the concept of vectorization, which
% is helpful for writing efficient and "clean" code.  Vectorization is a 
% concept found not only in MATLAB but also C/C++, Fortran, and other
% languages.
%
% Opening the m-file lab1.m in the MATLAB editor, step through each
% part using cell mode to see the results.  Compare the output with the
% PDF, which was generated from this m-file.
%
% There are twelve (12) exercises in this lab that will be graded.  
% Write your solutions in the template, including appropriate descriptions 
% in each step. Save the .m file as lab1_<UTORid>.m and submit it online on
% Quercus. Also, submit a PDF of the output by generating html (by going to
% 'File', 'Publish') and then saving to a PDF called lab1_<UTORid>.pdf.

%% Creating Vectors Explicitly
% MATLAB plots vectors (also known as arrays) of data points.  The first 
% way to create vectors is to give MATLAB a list of values of the form:
%
% x = [value1, value2, value3, ..., valueN];
%
% We can then see the values in the array x by entering |x| without a
% semilcolon or with the command |disp(x)|, with or without the semicolon.
%
% Individual entries of the vector can be accessed with the command |x(i)|, 
% where |i| is between 1 and the length of the array.  If |i| is not in 
% this range an error is thrown.
%
% Examine the following commands and their output.

x = [.5, 1.0, 2.3, 4.0, 4.333, 5.];     %These are arbitrary values
x
disp(x)
disp(x);
x(1)
x(2)

%% Exercise 1
% Objective: Observe a MATLAB error when you try to access an invalid
% index.
%
% Details: Try to access elements of the vector |x|, created in the
% previous step at the command prompt |>>|.  Try values of |i| outside the 
% valid range.  Try negative values, zero, and large positive values.  Copy
% down the error message in each case, and report this in your submitted 
% work as:
%
% Error for negative index:Array indices must be positive integers or logical values.

%
% Error for zero index:Array indices must be positive integers or logical values.

%
% Error for positive index outside of the bounds:Index exceeds the number of array elements (6).

%
% Only include the error message as a comment (with the percent signs), 
% DO NOT INCLUDE THE CODE IN YOUR SUBMISSION.

%% Plotting a Vector
% Given a list (one dimensional array) of values we can plot them with the
% command |plot(x)|, with or without a semicolon.  This will plot the points in the
% data set |(i, x(i))|.

plot(x)

%% Plotting Vector x against Vector y
% To plot functions, we need two vectors: a set of x points and a
% corresponding set of y points.  We now create a vector |y| and plot
% x against y with the command |plot(x,y)|.
%
% If the two vectors are not the same size, MATLAB will throw an error.

y = [3.7, -3.4, 1.02, 2.2, .04, 1.0];   %These are arbitrary values
plot(x,y)

%% Exercise 2
% Objective:  Create two vectors and plot one against the other.
%
% Details:  Explicitly create the vectors 
%
% x = [-5, -3, -1, 0, 2, 4, 6] 
%
% and 
%
% y = [-25, -9, -1, 0, 4, 16, 36]
%
% And plot |x| against |y|.  Your submission should show both the
% creation of the vectors and the figure, as in the example.
x = [-5, -3, -1, 0, 2, 4, 6] 
y = [-25, -9, -1, 0, 4, 16, 36]
plot(x,y)
%% Creating Vectors with For Loops
% Entering the values by hand is tedious and error prone.  We can use
% MATLAB's programming features to create them.  Suppose we want to create
% a vector of N points between 0 and 1, equally spaced and inclusive.  This
% would be useful if we wanted to evaluate a function, f(x), at all of
% these values.
%
% The distance between the points will be h = (1 - 0)/(N-1), so that:
%
% 0 = x(1) = 0 * h < x(2) = 1 * h < ... < x(j) = (j-1) * h < ... < x(N) =
% (N-1) * j = 1
%
% NOTE: if we with to do this between two arbitrary points, a < b, instead
% of 0 and 1, the values would be: h = (b - a)/(N-1) and a = x(1) = a + 0 *
% h < x(2) = a+ 1 * h < ... < x(j) = a +(j-1) * h < ...< x(N) = b
%
% We assign a value of N, compute h, preallocate a vector x, and then loop
% through the vector.
%
% By 'preallocate' we mean 'set aside an array of the appropriate size in 
% memory for future use'.  Preallocation can be done with the command
% |x = zeros(N,1);|, which makes an array of length N in which all the entries
% are zero.  Other options are possible, too.

N = 11;             %Alter this value to see different results
h = (1-0)/(N-1);
x = zeros(N,1);     %This creates a column vector.  
                    %zeros(1,N) would create a row vector.

for j = 1:N
    x(j) = (j-1) * h;
end
disp(x);

%% Plotting y = x^2
% As a first example of plotting a function, we plot y = x^2.  Using the
% array |x| created in the last step, we populate a vector |y| such that
% |y(i) = x(i)^2| and plot it.
%

y = zeros(N,1);     %Preallocate the array

for j = 1:N
    y(j) = x(j)^2;
end

disp(y);

plot(x,y)

%% Plotting y = sin(2 * pi * x)
% MATLAB has a number of built in functions including the trigonometric
% functions (sin, cos, arccos,...), the exponential functions (exp), the
% natural logarithm function (log), hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh), and
% others.  The constant |pi| is also defined.  For a full list of built in
% functions type |help elfun| at the MATLAB command line.  
%
% We create the vector |z| with |z(j) = sin(2*pi*x(j))|, using the same array as
% from the previous steps.

z = zeros(N,1);     %Preallocate the array

for j = 1:N
    z(j) = sin(2 * pi * x(j));
end

plot(x,z)

%% Exercise 3
% Objective:  Plot |x|.x
%
% Details:  Using a for loop, create a vector x of 101 equally spaced
% points between -3 and 7, inclusive.  Then create a vector y, such that
% |y(i) = abs(x(i))*x(i)| using a for loop.  Plot the results.  
%
% Your submission should include the code, as in the example, and 
% appropriate comments.
x=zeros(101,1);%make empty array
n=(7-(-3))/100;%make the divisions evenly spaces for 101 points
for i=1:101;%loop and populate array
    x(i)=-3+(i-1)*n;
end
y=zeros(101,1);%make empty array for y
for i=1:101;%fill y as specified
    y(i)=abs(x(i))*x(i);
end
plot(x,y)

%% Plotting Two Data Sets at Once
% We can also plot the preceding two examples on the same figure with the
% command |plot(x, y, x, z)|.  MATLAB will automatically put a different 
% color on each line.  

h=0.1              %redefine the variables x, y, z
x=0:h:1;           %because they might have been
y=x.^2;            %changed in exercise 3
z=sin(2*pi.*x);    %

plot(x,y,x,z)

%% Annotating a Figure
% It is easy to add a title, axis labels, and a legend to the
% preceding figure.
xlabel('x');
ylabel('f(x)');
title('Example plot of two functions plotted on the same figure');
legend('x^2', 'sin(2*pi*x)');

%% Using Help Effectively
% You can obtain help on any routine at the command line by typing |help
% commandname|.  As you may have noticed in the preceding figure, the
% legend was not placed in a convenient position.  We will now use help to
% find out how to move the legend to the lower left corner, where it will
% be less obtrusive.
%
% If you type |help legend| in the command window at the |>>| prompt, 
% you'll see a section:
%
% LEGEND(...,'Location',LOC) adds a legend in the specified
%    location, LOC, with respect to the axes.  LOC may be either a
%    1x4 position vector or one of the following strings:
%
%        'North'              inside plot box near top
%        'South'              inside bottom
%        'East'               inside right
%        'West'               inside left
%        'NorthEast'          inside top right (default)
%        'NorthWest           inside top left
%        'SouthEast'          inside bottom right
%        'SouthWest'          inside bottom left
%
% Thus, if we call |legend| again, with the option 
% |'Location', 'SouthWest'|, it will move the legend to where we want.

%NOTE: The labels are entered again.
legend('x^2', 'sin(2*pi*x)','Location','SouthWest');    

%% Vectorization - An Elegant Alternative to Loops
% In the previous examples, we used for loops to fill our arrays with the
% values we wanted.  This is very similar to what would be done in C/C++,
% Java, Fortran, and other languages.  
%
% MATLAB provides a faster way to perform these looped operations, using
% vectorization, which proccesses the entire vector as a single object.
% For example, given a vector |x|, we can get the sine of the values in |x|
% with the command |sin(x)|, which outputs another vector.  This works with
% all built in MATLAB functions.  
% 
% Multiplication, division, and exponentiation are handled differently.
% Instead of using |*|, |/|, and |^|, we must use |.*|, |./|, and |.^| to
% indicate that we want the operation to be performed on each element.  The
% reason for this change in the symbols is that MATLAB uses the symbols
% without the period for matrix multiplication, exponentiation, and other
% actions.
%
% Vectorization yields more concise and less error prone code:


y = x.^2;               %Alternatively, y = x .* x;
z = sin(2 * pi * x);    %NOTE:  Multiplcation by the scalar 2*pi, does not 
                        %       require the .* operator.  Why is that?

plot(x,y,x,z)           %Verify that these are the same results
xlabel('x');
ylabel('f(x)');
title('Example plot of two functions computed by vectorizaiton');
legend('x^2', 'sin(2*pi*x)','Location','SouthWest');

%% Speed Comparison
% Historically, it was desirable both for clarity and speed to use
% vecotrized operations in place of loops everywhere possible in MATLAB.  
% Recent versions of MATLAB have reduced the speed advantage through the 
% introduction of a Just in Time (JIT) compiler, parallel for loops, and 
% other tools.
%
% However, we can still demonstrate the speed advantage, and the benefit to
% clarity is already evident.
%
% Timing is done with the |tic|, |toc| commands, which enclose the region we
% want to benchmark. The first output is the time for the construction done
% by looping, the second output is the time for construction done with
% vectorization.
%

clear y;    %Clear the y array
tic;        %Begin timing the construciton and filling of the array

y = zeros(N,1);

for j = 1:N
    y(j) = x(j)^2;
end

toc;

clear y;    %Clear the y array
tic;
y = x.^2;
toc;

%% Exercise 4
% Objective:  Compare the speedup from vectorization for a larger vector.
%
% Details:  Create a vector |x| of 5000001 equally space points between -2 and
% 3, inclusive, using a for loop.  Then time the construction of vector |y|,
% whose values are arctan of x, by a for loop and by vectorization.  Be sure to clear 
% |y| between the two runs.  (Hint: use the help file to find the command for arctan!)
%
% Your submission should include the code, as in the example, with
% appropriate comments.
n=(3-(-2))/5000000;%form division value
x=zeros(5000001,1);%form vector x
for i=1:5000001;
    x(i)=-2+(i-1)*n;%populate x
end
tic%begin timing
y=zeros(5000001,1);%create vector y
for i=1:5000001;
    y(i)=atan(x(i));%populate y with given function
end
toc%end timing
clear y%clear the values in y
tic%begin timing
y=atan(x);%repopulate y(vectorized)
toc%end timing


%% Further Avoiding Loops with linspace
% In the preceding examples, we will focus on the vector |x|, which was
% constructed with a |for| loop.  MATLAB includes a routine for creating a
% vector of a given number, |N|, of equally spaced points between two
% values, |a| and |b|:
%
% |x = linspace(a, b, N);|
%
% No preallocation is neccessary.  The argument |N| is optional.  If it is
% omitted MATLAB uses 100 points by default.
%
% We will now use linspace to plot the functions y = x - x^3 and y = exp(x)
% in the range [-2, 4] with 200 points.

clear all;                  %Clears all variables

x = linspace(-2,4, 200);    %Create the array

y = x - x.^3;
z = exp(x);

plot(x,y,x,z)           %Verify that these are the same results
xlabel('x');
ylabel('f(x)');
title('Example plot of two functions generated by vectorizaiton');
legend('x-x^3', 'exp(x)','Location','SouthWest');

%% Exercise 5
% Objective:  Solve an ODE and plot three particular solutions.
%
% Details:  Manually find the general solution of the ODE:
%
% dy/dt + (2*t)*y = 1/exp(t^2)
% and the particular solutions for initial conditions y(1) = -1, y(1) = 0,
% and y(1) = 1. Plot these three particular solutions on the same axes
% lettting the independent variable range from 1 to 5. 
%
% Once you have the three particular solutions you will
% need to:
%
%  1. Create a vector for the independent variable, t.  Use linspace with
%  a reasonable number of points (100 is fine).
%  2. Create vectors for the three solutions.  Use vectorized operations.
%  3. Plot three solutions on the same axes, annotating the figure
%   appropriately.
%
% Your submission should include, in the description section, the general 
% solution of the ODE and the three particular solutions.  It should also 
% have the appropriately commented code.
t = linspace(1,5,100); %make t
%y=t./exp(t.^2)+c./exp(t.^2), %general solution,y(1)=-1,0,1
y1=(t./(exp(t.^2)))+((-exp(1)-1)./(exp(t.^2)))%solution for y(1)=-1
y2=(t./(exp(t.^2)))+((-1)./exp(t.^2))%solution for y(1)=0
y3=(t./(exp(t.^2)))+((exp(1)-1)./exp(t.^2))%solution for y(1)=1
plot(t,y1,t,y2,t,y3)
xlabel('t');
ylabel('y');
title('y vs t For Multiple Functions');
%% More Plotting Examples - Line Style
% There are many plotting options available, including color, line style,
% and marker style.  Some options can be found from the |help plot|
% command.  This is done by incuding a command after each line.
%
% In the first we example we will vary the line style.


x = linspace(-5,5);

%Plot three functions with different line styles.  NOTE: the
%function can be put directly in the plot argument.
plot(x, sin(x),'--', x, cos(x),'-.', x, exp(-x.^2),':');   
legend('sin', 'cos', 'exp(-x^2)');

%% More Plotting Examples - Line Color
% We can also control the color, mixing it with line style.

%Plot two functions, first in green and then in red.
x = linspace(-1,1);
plot(x, x.^3 .* sin(x), 'g', x, -x .* exp(x), 'r-');
legend('x^3 * sin(x)', '-x * exp(x)');

%% More Plotting Examples - Markers
% Markers can be used at the individual points, with and without a line 
% joining the points.
x = linspace(-4,4, 20);
plot(x, sin(x), 'x-', x, (x.^2)./(1+x.^2), '.');
legend('sin(x)', 'x^2/(1+x^2)');

%% Inline functions of one variable
% 
% Suppose we wish to construct the function:
%
% |f(x) = x * sin(x)|
%
% In a way that MATLAB can understand and manipulate.  This will let us
% compute values of |f(x)|, plot it, and create other functions from it.
%
% This can be accomplished by defining an inline function of one variable,
% with the command:
%
% function name = @(argument name) mathematical expression;
%
% For this example, the function name is |f|, the argument name is |x|, and
% the mathematical expression is |x * sin(x)|.
%
% Consider the following examples, and take note of:
%
% 1. The use of vectorization in the definitions, 2. The different ways
% that the output can be displayed, 3. The different variable names.
%

f = @(x) x .* sin(x);

x = 1;
fprintf(' f(%g) = %g\n', x, f(x));
fprintf(' f(%g) = %g\n', 1, f(1));
disp(f(1));
f(1)
x = 2;
fprintf(' f(%g) = %g\n', 2, f(2));
fprintf(' f(%g) = %g\n', 2, f(2));
disp(f(2));
f(2)

disp(f([1,2]))

g = @(t) t.^2 - t +1;
g(1)
g(2)

% Construct an array of 100 grid points from -2 to 2, and plot g(t).
t = linspace(-2,2);
plot(t, g(t));
% Label axes
xlabel('t');
ylabel('g');


%% Exercise 6
%
% Objective: Write and use an inline function of one variable.
%
% Details: Define the inline function for
%
% |f(x) = (x^3 - abs(x)) * ln(x^2+1)|
%
% Use this function to compute |f(0)|, |f(1)|, and |f(-1)| and plot the
% function with 100 grid points from -5 to 5. Make sure to
% use vectorization in your definition, and label your axes.
%
% Your submission should show the definition of the function, and the
% computation of these values.
f=@(x)(x.^3-abs(x)).*log(x.^2+1);
f0=f(0)
f1=f(1)
f2=f(-1)
x=linspace(-5,5,100);
plot(x,f(x))
xlabel('x')
ylabel('f(x)')
title('f(x) vs x');


%% Inline functions of two variables
%
% Suppose we wish to solve the equation 
%
% |x = y^3 + y|
%
% for |y| as a function of |x|.  If we do this by root finding, then, given
% a value of |x0|, we need to find the root of the function
%
% |g(y) = f(x0,y) = y^3 + y - x0|
%
% We will accomplish this using inline functions.
%
% Inline functions of two variables are defined as:
%
% func = @(x,y) f(x,y);
%
% where func is the name you wish to assign your function, and |f(x,y)| is
% the relevant expression.
%
% Some examples of defining and using inline functions of two variables
% are given below. 
%

f = @(x,y) y.^3 + y - x;
x = 0; y = 0;
fprintf(' f(x = %g, y = %g) = %g\n', x, y, f(x, y));
x = 0; y = 1;
fprintf(' f(x = %g, y = %g) = %g\n', x, y, f(x, y));
disp(f(x,y))
f(0,1)

h = @(t,u) t.^2  + sin(u);
h(1, pi/2)
h(2, 2)



%% Exercise 7
%
% Objective: Write and use an inline function of two variables.
%
% Details: Define the inline function for
%
% |f(x,y) = y + y^3 - cos x + x^2 - x^4|
%
% Note that |f(x,y) = c| is the implicit solution to 
%
% |dy/dx = (4x^3 - 2x - sin x)/(1+3y^2)|.
%
% See Examples 1-3 of section 2.1 in Brannan and Boyce for similar examples.
%
% Use this function to compute |f(0, 0)|, |f(pi/2,1)|, and |f(-1,-1)|.  Make
% sure to use vectorization in your definition.
%
% Your submission should show the definition of the function, and the
% computation of these values.
f = @(x,y) y+ y.^3 - cos(x)+ x.^2 - x.^4;
f0=f(0,0)
f1=f(pi/2,1)
f2=f(-1,-1)

%% Numerically solving an implicit equation
%
% Given |x0|, we will now solve the equation
%
% |f(x0, y) = y^3 + y - x0 = 0|
%
% for y.  This will be accomplished using fzero, which employs a more
% advanced form of Newton's method. 
%
% The minimal arguments needed for using fzero are:
%
% fzero(function_handle, guess)
%
% function_handle is an abstract data structure which directs MATLAB
% towards a function of a single variable that it will try to zero.
%
% We need to tell MATLAB that it is trying to solve for the |y| argument.
% This is done by creating an inline function of one variable from the
% existing function, i.e.
% 
% g = @(y) f(x0, y)
%
% And then having fzero try to solve
%
% |g(y) = 0|
%
% You can either define the new inline function and use it:
%
% g = @(y) f(x0, y);
% y = fzero(g, guess);
%
% or you can put the inline function argument directly in the function
% handle argument:
%
% y = fzero(@(y) f(x0,y), guess);
% 
% The guess is an initial guess for what we anticipate y to be.  Finding a
% good initial guess may require some experimentation. For this example,
% the guess may be quite poor, and the algorithm will still converge.  For
% others, more care must be taken.
%
% Note the various ways of constructing the inline function of one
% variable, and the different guesses.


f = @(x,y) y.^3 + y - x;

x0 = 1;
guess = 1;
g = @(y) f(x0, y);
y = fzero(g, guess);
fprintf(' y(%g) = %g\n', x0, y);

guess = 50;
y = fzero(g, guess);
fprintf(' y(%g) = %g\n', x0, y);

x = 2;
g = @(y) f(x, y);
y = fzero(g, 2);
fprintf(' y(%g) = %g\n', x, y);

guess = 2;
y = fzero(@(y) f(2, y), guess);
fprintf(' y(%g) = %g\n', 2, y);

%% Exercise 8
%
% Objective: Use fzero to solve an equation |f(x,y)=0| for y at different
% values of x.
%
% Details: Consider the function
%
% |f(x,y) = y + y^3 - cos x + x^2 - x^4|
%
% Define the appropriate inline function and compute the single solution 
% at |x = 0| and the two positive solutions at |y = 1/2|.  
%
% You will need to experiment with different guesses to get these three
% solutions.
%
% Your submission should show the definition of the function, and the
% computation of these three roots.
f=@(x,y) y + y.^3 - cos(x) + x.^2 - x.^4;
x0=0;
g=@(y) f(x0,y);
guess=0;
y= fzero(g,guess)

y0=0.5;
g=@(x) f(x,y0);
guess=1;
x= fzero(g,guess)

y0=0.5;
g=@(x) f(x,y0);
guess=0.5;
x= fzero(g,guess)

%% Plotting the solution
%
% Now we are ready to plot y as a function of x.  We will construct an
% array of x values, solve for y at each value of x, and then plot the
% results.  This will be accomplished with a for loop.

f = @(x,y) y.^3 + y - x;

% 50 points equally spaced from -5 to 2, inclusive
xvals = linspace(-5, 2, 50); 

% Preallocate storage space for the solutions
yvals = zeros(size(xvals));      

% Loop through all the values
for j = 1:length(xvals)
   
   yvals(j) = fzero(@(y) f(xvals(j), y), 0);
   
end

% Plot the results

plot(xvals, yvals);
xlabel('x');
ylabel('y');

%% Exercise 9
%
% Objective: Plot a portion of an implicit equation.
%

%% Install iode
%
% Objective: install iode
%
% Details: visit https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/iode/ and follow the
% instructions there to download and install iode.
%
% Iode has a problem (with MATLAB versions 2014a and above), but can be
% easily fixed. In MATLAB open the folder where you installed iode and 
% double-click the file fixaxes.m. Quote (comment out) line 38: it should 
% look like %eval(’delete(a:);’); Do the same for the file freeaxes.m and 
% line 24.

%% Exercise 11
%
% Objective: use iode a plot the direction field of a differential equation
%
% Details: After starting iode, click the "direction fields" buttom from 
% the main menu. The default is the direction field for
%
% |dy/dx = sin(y-x)|
%
% Click any point in the x-y plane to see a (numerically computed) solution
% to the differential equation passing through that point.
%
% Starting from the "Equation" menu, plot the direction field of 
%
% |dy/dx = xy^2|
%
% Describe, in words, the behaviour of the solutions. What happens as x
% approaches infinity? Explain why solutions are symmetric about the 
% y-axis, i.e. |y(x)=y(-x)| for any solution.

%Answer:
%For solutions above the y=0 line, the solutions diverge to infinity on 
%both sides and behave like even functions, while solutions lying below y=0 
%diverge to negative infinity when approaching x=0 and conferge to 0 when
%approaching y=0. Solutions are symmetric about the y axis as the 
%magnitude of dy/dx are the same about the y-axis, but opposite in sign  
%(y^2 keeps being positive), but x changes depending on which side of the 
%y-axis the solution is on). As such, the solutions approach (0,0) coming 
%from the left and diverge to infinity in a similar pattern going to the 
%right when above the x-axis, while the solutions below the x-axis all 
%diverge to negative infinity when approaching the y=axis, and converge to 
%0 when approaching the x-axis

%% Exercise 12
%
% Objective: study the long-run behaviour of a differential equation from 
% its direction field
%
% Details: Using iode, plot the direction field of 
%
% |dy/dx = y^4 - y^3 - 3*y^2 + y + 2|
%
% By clicking on various initial conditions |y(0) = y_0| (iode plots the
% solution), determine the long-run behaviour of solutions as a function of
% |y_0|. In other words, list the constant solutions that are approached as
% x goes to infinity and how |y_0| determines which constant solution is 
% approached.
%
% If your numerically computed solutions ever appear to cross then change
% the solution method from Euler to the, much better, Runge-Kutta method.
% Think about why solutions are not permitted to cross. If they do then
% this indicates a problem with the numerical solver.
%
%For initial conditions y_0=-1,1,and 2, there appear to be horizontal
%lines for these values of y across all x. When y_0 lies between -1 to 1 or
%1 to 2, the solutions are bounded between the aforementioned values of y
%for all x, with y going to the smaller value when the solution goes to the 
%left and to the larger of the 2 bounds when heading to the right. For y_0 
%values greater than 2, the solution will diverge to infinity as the 
%solution moves to the right, and y_0 values less than -1 will converge to 
%-1 as x goes to infinity. 

%Different starting conditions change the constant solution approached as
%the solutions will follow the directional field where the initial point
%landed on, and therefore can behave in any of the aforemention ways
%mentioned based on the location of the point between the various boundries
%of y.
